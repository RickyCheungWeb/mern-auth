        Hello, I'm Ricky, an aspiring developer with a profound passion for
        coding and application development. I've been actively engaged in
        expanding my knowledge of React through online courses, gaining
        proficiency in React hooks, Redux, and React Router. Additionally, I'm
        currently working on gaining backend experience by constructing a
        foundational backend using NodeJS, MongoDB, and Firebase.
      </p>
      <p className='mb-4 text-slate-700'>
        In tandem with my self-learning journey, I recently completed a
        Certificate IV in Information Technology (Web Development) at TAFE. The
        program covered a range of topics, including web content transfer, PHP,
        relational database query language, JavaScript, Python, HTML, CMS,
        website accessibility, SEO, responsive website layouts, and cyber
        security risk management.

        This application marks the inception of my personal exploration into
        developing full-stack web applications with authentication using the
        MERN stack. I'm enthusiastic about embarking on my career as a front-end
        or full-stack developer. Feel free to contact me at 0420 883 450 or via
        email at rickycreact@gmail.com.
